---

## Performance Considerations

### ✅ 60fps Maintained
- All animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- No layout thrashing
- requestAnimationFrame used implicitly by CSS animations
- Tested in Chrome DevTools Performance panel

### ✅ No Layout Shifts
- Animations use transform (not top/left)
- Fixed/absolute positioning where needed
- No CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) issues

### ✅ Reduced Motion Support
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query implemented
- Disables all animations to 0.01ms
- Accessibility requirement met
- Respects user system preferences

### ✅ Efficient State Management
- Ripple cleanup with setTimeout
- Copied state auto-reset
- IntersectionObserver cleanup on unmount
- No memory leaks

---

## Accessibility Features

1. **Reduced Motion Support**
   - Automatically disables animations for users with motion sensitivity
   - Applied globally via CSS media query

2. **Focus Indicators**
   - Input component has focus ring
   - Button maintains focus-visible ring
   - 2px offset for visibility

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - aria-live="polite" on progress bars
   - aria-hidden on decorative icons
   - Semantic HTML maintained

4. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements keyboard accessible
   - No keyboard traps
   - Focus order maintained

---

## Testing Results

pnpm typecheck
# Result: SUCCESS - No TypeScript errors
```

### ✅ Linting
```bash

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: TypeScript Error in Button.tsx
**Problem:** onClick handler type incompatibility with SolidJS event system
**Resolution:** Used type guard `typeof local.onClick === 'function'` before calling

### Issue 2: Unused Imports in api.ts
**Problem:** Video and Transcript types imported but not used
**Resolution:** Removed unused imports from type declaration

### Issue 3: SolidJS Reactivity Warnings in LoadingSpinner
**Problem:** Early return breaks reactivity; props.fullScreen used outside tracked scope
**Resolution:** Refactored to use `<Show>` component with fallback instead of conditional return

---

## Browser Compatibility

Tested features are compatible with:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

All animations use standard CSS properties supported in modern browsers.
