üöÄ **Just shipped TranscriptAI after 5 weeks of building**

The problem: You're 45 minutes into a tutorial trying to find that one code snippet. You scrub. Rewatch. Waste time.

YouTube's transcript feature is just raw text. No search, no intelligence, nothing useful.

**So I built TranscriptAI** ‚Üí https://transcriptai.conn.digital

**What it does:**
‚Ä¢ Generate AI summaries (brief, detailed, key points)
‚Ä¢ Extract code snippets automatically
‚Ä¢ Ask questions about the video without watching
‚Ä¢ Pull quotes and action items
‚Ä¢ Download in multiple formats

**Tech:**
‚Ä¢ Next.js 15 + TypeScript
‚Ä¢ Go + PostgreSQL
‚Ä¢ Google Gemini AI

**Results:**
‚Ä¢ 1-2 second response time
‚Ä¢ 95% cache hit rate
‚Ä¢ $20/month operating cost
‚Ä¢ Zero TypeScript errors

**Key lessons:**

**1. Cache everything**
AI is expensive. Process once, retrieve instantly. 95% cache hit rate = 95% cost savings.

**2. Don't expose your backend**
Server-side proxy with Next.js API routes. Browser only sees `/api/transcripts/*`. Backend stays hidden.

**3. Build for flexibility**
Multi-provider AI interface. Can switch between Gemini, GPT-4, or Claude with one environment variable.

**4. Index your database**
Added strategic indexes. Queries went from 15ms to 0.74ms. 10x speedup with a few lines of SQL.

**Free during beta. No sign-up.**

üöÄ **Launched TranscriptAI: Turn YouTube videos into AI-powered insights**

Ever waste time searching through hour-long tutorials for one code snippet?

I built TranscriptAI to fix this:
‚Ä¢ AI summaries in seconds
‚Ä¢ Code extraction
‚Ä¢ Q&A without watching
‚Ä¢ Action item detection

**Tech:** Next.js 15, Go, PostgreSQL, Gemini AI

**Speed:** 1-2 seconds
**Cost:** $20/month (for thousands of users)

**Key insight:** Cache aggressively. 95% hit rate = 95% cost savings.

**The 2-hour tutorial problem**

Last week, I spent 15 minutes searching through a 2-hour React tutorial for a single useEffect example.

Frustrated, I built TranscriptAI over 5 weeks.

**Now I can:**
‚Ä¢ Get a 3-sentence summary before watching
‚Ä¢ Extract all code snippets in one click
‚Ä¢ Ask "What database does this use?" and get instant answers
‚Ä¢ Pull action items from meeting recordings

**Built with:**
Next.js 15, Go, PostgreSQL, Google Gemini

**Interesting challenges:**

**Hiding infrastructure:** Server-side proxy pattern. Browser never sees backend URLs.

**Cost optimization:** Switched from GPT-4 ($0.01/request) to Gemini ($0.001/request). 90% savings.

**Performance:** Database indexing gave us 10x speedup (15ms ‚Üí 0.74ms queries).

**Free during beta:**

No sign-up, no credit card. Just paste a YouTube URL.

## Response Templates

**"This looks amazing!"**
‚Üí Thanks! What feature would you use most?

**"What's your tech stack?"**
‚Üí Next.js 15 + TypeScript frontend, Go + PostgreSQL backend, Google Gemini for AI. Built for speed and low cost.

**"How do you handle scaling?"**
‚Üí Smart caching is key. 95% cache hit rate means we process each video once, then serve from database. Can handle thousands of users on current setup.

**"Why Gemini over GPT-4?"**
‚Üí Cost. Gemini is $0.001/request vs $0.01 for GPT-4. 90% savings with similar quality for our use case. Plus we built multi-provider support to avoid lock-in.
