# Building TranscriptAI: An AI-Powered YouTube Transcript Analysis Platform

**By Conn.Digital** | Published: October 2025

---

## 🎯 The Problem

As a developer, content creator, or researcher, you've probably found yourself in this situation: watching a 2-hour YouTube tutorial or conference talk, desperately trying to find that one code snippet or quote mentioned 45 minutes in. You scrub through the timeline, rewatch sections, and waste valuable time.

YouTube's built-in transcript feature exists, but it's basic. You get raw text with timestamps—nothing more. No AI summaries, no code extraction, no intelligent search. That's where **TranscriptAI** comes in.

---

## ✨ What is TranscriptAI?

**TranscriptAI** (https://transcriptai.conn.digital) is a free, AI-powered platform that transforms YouTube videos into actionable insights. It's not just a transcript downloader—it's an intelligent analysis tool that helps you:

- 📝 **Download transcripts instantly** in multiple formats
- 🤖 **Generate AI summaries** (brief, detailed, or key points)
- 💻 **Extract code snippets** automatically with syntax highlighting
- 💬 **Pull out important quotes** with speaker context
- ✅ **Identify action items** from meetings and tutorials
- 🔍 **Ask questions** about the video content without watching it

**Live Demo:** https://transcriptai.conn.digital

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture: The Proxy Layer Pattern

One of the most interesting technical challenges was **hiding our backend infrastructure from clients** while maintaining performance. Here's how we solved it:

**Problem:** Direct client-to-backend communication exposes your infrastructure:
```
❌ Browser → https://backend.example.com/api/...
   (Backend URL visible in browser DevTools)
```

**Solution:** Server-side proxy layer with Next.js API routes:
```
✅ Browser → Next.js Proxy → Go Backend (hidden)
   (Browser only sees /api/transcripts/*)
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/app/api/transcripts/fetch/route.ts
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.text();

  // Forward to hidden backend
  const backendResponse = await backendFetch(
    '/api/v1/transcripts/fetch',
    { method: 'POST', body }
  );

  return NextResponse.json(await backendResponse.json());
}
```

**Benefits:**
- 🔒 Backend URL completely hidden from browser
- 🔒 Professional, clean API surface (`/api/transcripts/*`)
- 🔒 Same-origin requests (better security)
- 🚀 No performance impact (Next.js handles caching)

### Next.js 15 Migration: Async Params

We encountered Next.js 15's breaking change with dynamic route parameters. Previously synchronous params became async Promises:

**Before (Next.js 14):**
```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  const id = params.id; // Direct access
}
```

**After (Next.js 15):**
```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  context: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
) {
  const params = await context.params; // Await the Promise
  const id = params.id;
}
```

This required updating 5 API routes, but ensured full Next.js 15 compatibility with zero TypeScript errors.

### AI Integration: Multi-Provider Strategy

We designed a flexible AI provider system supporting multiple backends:

```go
// ai_service.go
type AIProvider interface {
    GenerateSummary(transcript string, summaryType string) (*SummaryResult, error)
    ExtractContent(transcript string, extractionType string) (*ExtractionResult, error)
    AnswerQuestion(transcript string, question string) (*QAResult, error)
}

// Implementations: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini
```

**Why this matters:**
- 🔄 Switch AI providers via environment variable
- 💰 Compare costs (Gemini is ~90% cheaper than GPT-4)
- 🚀 Fallback options if one provider is down
- 🧪 A/B test different models for quality

**Current setup:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Cost:** ~$0.001 per request
- **Speed:** 1-2 seconds average
- **Quality:** Excellent for summaries and extractions

### Database Optimization

Smart caching reduces API costs and improves performance:

```sql
-- Migration 002: Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_videos_youtube_id ON videos(youtube_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transcripts_video_id ON transcripts(video_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transcripts_video_language ON transcripts(video_id, language);

-- Query performance
SELECT * FROM videos WHERE youtube_id = 'dQw4w9WgXcQ';
-- Result: ~0.74ms (with index) vs ~15ms (without)
```

**Caching strategy:**
1. User requests transcript for video `XYZ`
2. Check cache: `SELECT * FROM transcripts WHERE video_id = 'XYZ'`
3. If found: Return instantly (<30ms)
4. If not found: Fetch from YouTube, cache, then return (~1-2s)
5. Future requests: Instant retrieval from cache

**Result:** 95%+ cache hit rate after the first week

- Preserves accurate timestamps
- Caches results for instant retrieval
- Handles edge cases (private videos, age-restricted content)

### 2. AI-Powered Summaries

Generate three types of summaries:

**Brief (2-3 sentences):**
> "This tutorial covers React hooks including useState and useEffect. The instructor demonstrates building a todo app with real-time updates. Key concepts include component lifecycle and state management patterns."

**Detailed (multi-paragraph):**
> Comprehensive analysis with sections, context, and detailed explanations.

**Key Points (bulleted list):**
> - useState manages local component state
> - useEffect handles side effects and cleanup
> - Custom hooks enable code reuse
> - Context API prevents prop drilling

### 3. Content Extraction

**Code Snippets:**
```typescript
// Automatically extracted with:
// - Language detection (TypeScript)
// - Syntax highlighting
// - Context explanation
// - Line number references

function useFetch<T>(url: string): { data: T | null, loading: boolean } {
  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url).then(res => res.json()).then(setData).finally(() => setLoading(false));
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}
```

**Quotes:**
> "The key to understanding React is realizing that components are just functions that return UI."
> — Speaker: Tutorial Instructor | Importance: High

**Action Items:**
- [ ] **HIGH:** Refactor authentication logic to use JWT tokens
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Add error boundary to prevent app crashes
- [ ] **LOW:** Update documentation with new API endpoints

### 4. Intelligent Q&A

Ask questions about the video without watching it:

**Question:** "What is the main promise made in this song?"

**Answer:**
The central promise is one of unwavering loyalty and commitment. The singer pledges to never give up on the relationship, never let the other person down, never run around and desert them, never make them cry, never say goodbye, and never tell a lie to hurt them.

**Confidence:** High

**Sources:**
> "Never going to give you up. Never going to let you down..."
> "Never going to run around and desert you..."

## 🎨 UX/UI Highlights

### Smooth Animations (60fps)
All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility:

```css
/* Custom Tailwind animations */
@keyframes fade-in {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes slide-in-right {
  from { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
  to { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes shimmer {
  0% { background-position: -1000px 0; }
  100% { background-position: 1000px 0; }
}
```

**Animated components:**
- Loading spinners with smooth rotation
- Skeleton loaders with shimmer effect
- Toast notifications with slide-in
- Button ripple effects
- Card hover lift effects

- **Large:** 1920px+ (4K displays)

**Layout scaling:** 80% base font-size ensures consistent appearance across zoom levels (development at 80% zoom, production at 100% zoom).

### Dark Mode

Full dark mode support with smooth transitions:

```typescript
// Theme provider with system preference detection
<ThemeProvider
  attribute="class"
  defaultTheme="system"
  enableSystem
  disableTransitionOnChange={false}
>
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

Colors optimized for:
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
