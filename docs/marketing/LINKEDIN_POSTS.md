🚀 **Launching TranscriptAI: Transform YouTube Videos into Actionable Insights**

After 5 weeks of intensive development, I'm excited to share **TranscriptAI** — a free AI-powered platform that goes beyond basic transcript downloading.

**What makes it different?**

✨ **AI-Powered Analysis:**
• Generate summaries (brief, detailed, or key points)
• Extract code snippets automatically
• Pull important quotes with context
• Identify action items from videos
• Ask questions about content without watching

🔧 **Built with:**
• Next.js 15 + TypeScript (frontend)
• Go + PostgreSQL (backend)
• Google Gemini AI (analysis)
• CapRover (deployment)

⚡ **Performance:**
• 1-2 seconds for 40-minute videos
• 95% cache hit rate
• <$20/month operating cost

🔒 **Security-first:**
• Server-side proxy layer (backend URL hidden)
• Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors
• WCAG 2.1 AA accessible

**Live now:** https://transcriptai.conn.digital

I wrote a detailed technical breakdown covering:
• The proxy layer architecture pattern
• Next.js 15 migration challenges
• Multi-provider AI strategy
• Database optimization (10x speedup)
• Production deployment on CapRover

🏗️ **Technical Breakdown: Building a Production-Ready AI Platform in 5 Weeks**

Just shipped **TranscriptAI** (https://transcriptai.conn.digital) and wanted to share some key technical decisions:

**Challenge #1: Hiding Backend Infrastructure**
❌ Problem: Direct client-to-backend calls expose your API URLs
✅ Solution: Server-side proxy with Next.js API routes

```
Browser → /api/transcripts/* → Go Backend (hidden)
```

Result: Zero backend URLs visible in browser DevTools. Professional, secure API surface.

**Challenge #2: Next.js 15 Breaking Changes**
The async params migration hit all 5 dynamic routes. Changed from:
```typescript
{ params }: { params: { id: string } }
```
To:
```typescript
context: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
```

Zero TypeScript errors now ✅

**Challenge #3: AI Cost Optimization**
GPT-4 was $0.01/request. Switched to Gemini 2.5 Flash:
• $0.001/request (90% cheaper)
• 1-2 second response time
• Excellent quality for summaries

Built a multi-provider interface for easy switching.

**Challenge #4: Database Performance**
Added strategic indexes on frequently queried columns:
• Before: ~15ms query time
• After: ~0.74ms (10x faster)

**Tech Stack:**
Frontend: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui
Backend: Go, PostgreSQL, Docker
AI: Google Gemini (with OpenAI/Anthropic fallbacks)
Deploy: CapRover (self-hosted PaaS)

**Results:**
✅ 95% cache hit rate
✅ 1-2s avg response time
✅ ~$20/month operating cost
✅ 85%+ test coverage
✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessible

⏰ **The 2-Hour YouTube Video Problem**

You know that feeling when you're 45 minutes into a tutorial, trying to find that ONE code snippet the instructor mentioned?

You scrub through the timeline. Rewatch sections. Waste 10 minutes.

I faced this constantly as a developer. YouTube's transcript feature exists, but it's just raw text. No search, no AI analysis, nothing intelligent.

**So I built TranscriptAI** → https://transcriptai.conn.digital

**Now I can:**
• Generate a 3-sentence summary before watching
• Extract all code snippets in one click
• Ask "What database does this tutorial use?" and get an instant answer
• Pull action items from hour-long client calls
• Search for specific concepts across saved transcripts

**Example:**
Watched a 90-minute React conference talk. Asked TranscriptAI:
*"What are the main performance optimization techniques mentioned?"*

Got a detailed answer with timestamps and quotes. Saved 80 minutes.

**Free during beta.** No sign-up required.

**Built with:**
Next.js 15, Go, PostgreSQL, Google Gemini AI

**Features:**
✅ AI summaries (brief, detailed, key points)
✅ Code extraction with syntax highlighting
✅ Quote extraction with speaker context
✅ Action item identification
✅ Intelligent Q&A
✅ Multi-format export (JSON, TXT, SRT)

**Try it:** https://transcriptai.conn.digital

📸 **Behind the Scenes: 5 Weeks Building TranscriptAI**

Week 1: "This should be simple. Fetch transcripts, add some AI. Done in a weekend."

Week 5: 15,000+ lines of code, 6 production deployments, 158 tests passing. 😅

**What I learned:**

**On Architecture:**
Don't expose your backend URLs. Ever. Server-side proxy layers are worth the extra 50ms latency.

**On AI Providers:**
Started with GPT-4. Bills were scary. Switched to Gemini. Same quality, 90% cheaper. Multi-provider design = future flexibility.

**On Performance:**
Database indexes matter. 10x speedup with 3 lines of SQL. Profile early, optimize often.

**On User Experience:**
Smooth animations, dark mode, accessibility aren't "nice to have." They're table stakes in 2025.

**On Frameworks:**
Next.js 15 is powerful but breaking changes are real. TypeScript caught 47 bugs before production. Worth it.

**Metrics I'm proud of:**
• Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors
• 1-2 second average response time
• 95% cache hit rate
• $20/month operating cost
• WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility score

🎯 **TranscriptAI: From "I'll watch it later" to "I already know what's in it"**

**Real example from today:**

Received a 2-hour client call recording. Instead of watching:

1️⃣ Uploaded to **TranscriptAI**
2️⃣ Generated **brief summary**: "Client wants redesign focusing on mobile UX, launch target Q1 2026, budget $50k."
3️⃣ Extracted **action items**:
   • HIGH: Send wireframe mockups by Friday
   • MEDIUM: Research competitor mobile apps
   • LOW: Update project timeline document

4️⃣ Asked: *"What specific mobile features did they mention?"*
   Got: "Dark mode, offline capability, push notifications, biometric login"

**Time saved:** 1 hour 55 minutes.

**Other use cases I've tried:**
✅ Conference talks → Extract code examples
✅ Tutorial videos → Get step-by-step summaries
✅ Podcast interviews → Pull memorable quotes
✅ Product demos → Identify key features
✅ Educational lectures → Generate study notes

**Free beta access:** https://transcriptai.conn.digital

**Tech:** Next.js 15 • Go • PostgreSQL • Gemini AI

🤔 **Question for developers:**

You're building a production app with AI features.

**Option A:**
• OpenAI GPT-4
• ~$0.01 per request
• Best-in-class quality
• Vendor lock-in risk

**Option B:**
• Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
• ~$0.001 per request (90% cheaper!)
• Great quality (not quite GPT-4)
• Multi-provider flexibility

Which do you choose and why?

I chose B for **TranscriptAI** and built a provider interface to switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

Result: $20/month operating cost vs $200+
