• Searchable transcripts
• Q&A interface

In 1-2 seconds ⚡

Try it: https://transcriptai.conn.digital

Thread 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
The problem: You're 45 minutes into a 2-hour tutorial trying to find that ONE code snippet.

You scrub. Rewatch. Waste time.

YouTube's transcript feature is just raw text. No search, no AI, nothing useful.
```

```
TranscriptAI fixes this:

✅ Generate summaries (brief, detailed, key points)
✅ Extract code with syntax highlighting
✅ Ask questions without watching
✅ Pull quotes and action items
✅ Export in multiple formats

All powered by AI. All in <2 seconds.
```

**Tweet 4 (Tech Stack):**
```
Built with:
• Next.js 15 + TypeScript
• Go + PostgreSQL
• Google Gemini AI
• CapRover deployment

Performance:

3. Tech stack and why you chose it
4. Key challenges overcome
5. What you learned
6. Link to technical blog post

**Example first comment:**
```
Hi HN! I'm the creator of TranscriptAI.

I built this because I was tired of scrubbing through 2-hour tutorials to find specific code snippets. YouTube's transcript feature is just raw text with no intelligence.

TranscriptAI uses Gemini AI to:
- Generate summaries (brief, detailed, key points)
- Extract code snippets with context
- Answer questions about video content
- Pull quotes and action items

Tech stack: Next.js 15, Go, PostgreSQL, Gemini AI, deployed on CapRover.

Interesting challenges:
1. Hiding backend URLs with server-side proxy layer (Next.js API routes)
2. Migrating to Next.js 15's async params (5 routes updated)
3. Optimizing AI costs (switched from GPT-4 to Gemini, 90% cheaper)
4. Database indexing for 10x speedup

It's free during beta. Would love your feedback!

Live demo: https://transcriptai.conn.digital

Happy to answer questions!
```

**HN posting tips:**
- Post Tuesday-Thursday 8-10 AM PT
- Engage with comments immediately
- Be prepared for critical feedback
- Don't argue, explain
- If it gets traction, stay active for 24 hours

## 🎯 ENGAGEMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### Positive Comments

**"This looks amazing!"**
```
Thank you! What feature interests you most? Would love to hear what you'd use it for! 🚀
```

**"Great work!"**
```
Appreciate it! Took 5 weeks but learned a ton. Happy to answer any technical questions if you have them!
```

**"Bookmarked for later"**
```
Awesome! Let me know what you think when you try it. Always looking for feedback! 🙏
```

---

### Technical Questions

**"What's your tech stack?"**
```
Great question!

Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind
Backend: Go + PostgreSQL
AI: Google Gemini (with OpenAI/Anthropic fallbacks)
Deploy: CapRover on self-hosted VPS

Full breakdown here: [blog link]

What would you have chosen differently?
```

**"How do you handle scaling?"**
```
Smart caching is key:

1. First request: Fetch from YouTube → Cache in PostgreSQL
2. Subsequent requests: Instant retrieval (<30ms)
3. Result: 95% cache hit rate after first week

Database indexes on frequently queried columns give us ~10x speedup.

Currently handles 1000s of requests/day on a $20/month VPS. Can scale vertically or add read replicas as needed.
```

**"What about costs at scale?"**
```
Great question! Here's the breakdown:

At 10,000 users/month:
• AI costs: ~$20 (Gemini @ $0.001/request, 95% cached)
• Hosting: $20 (VPS)
• Database: Included
• Total: ~$40/month

At 100,000 users:
• AI costs: ~$200
• Hosting: ~$100 (upgraded VPS)
• Total: ~$300/month

Key: Caching reduces AI costs by 95%. Without it, costs would be 20x higher.
```

---

### Critical/Skeptical Comments

**"This already exists"**
```
You're right that transcript downloaders exist!

What makes TranscriptAI different:
• AI summaries (brief, detailed, key points)
• Code extraction with syntax highlighting
• Q&A system (ask questions without watching)
• Action item extraction
• Smart caching (<2s responses)

It's not just downloading - it's analysis. But I'd love to hear what features you think are missing!
```

**"Why not use ChatGPT?"**
```
Great point! You absolutely can copy transcripts into ChatGPT.

TranscriptAI adds:
1. Automatic fetching (no copy/paste)
2. Caching (instant on repeat requests)
3. Specialized prompts optimized for transcripts
4. Source citations with timestamps
5. Export in multiple formats

It's about speed and convenience. But if ChatGPT works for you, that's awesome too!
```

**"Security concerns?"**
```
Excellent question! Security was a priority:

✅ Backend URL hidden (server-side proxy)
✅ Input validation on all endpoints
✅ No user data stored (just transcripts for caching)
✅ Environment variables for secrets
✅ HTTPS everywhere
✅ CORS properly configured

What specific security aspects are you concerned about? Happy to provide more details!
```

---

### Feature Requests

**"Can you add [feature]?"**
```
Love this suggestion! [Feature] is actually on the roadmap for [timeframe].

Current priorities:
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Their suggestion]

Where would you rank it in importance? And what's your use case for it?

Always appreciate feedback - it helps prioritize! 🙏
```
