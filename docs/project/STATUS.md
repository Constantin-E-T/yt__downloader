## Highlights Since Last Update
- Shipped transcript export endpoint with JSON + plain text downloads, wired into the Export tab UI.
- Completed shadcn-driven global navigation and footer, integrated across the App Router layout.
- Added marketing/support pages (Landing, About, Pricing, How-to, Privacy, Terms).
- Hardened AI workspace (transcript, search, AI tabs) with URL-driven state management.
- Stood up dedicated Postgres instances for development and production environments.
- MCP configuration in place for shadcn component discovery across Codex/VS Code/Cursor.

## Active Work

| Task ID | Description | Owner | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 7.2-FE  | Export enhancements: clipboard helpers + SRT UX prototype | FRONTEND | üöß In progress |

## Recently Completed

- Backend `/export` API (JSON + TXT) with unit tests and timestamped renderers.
- Export tab UI with download buttons, metadata callout, and status messaging.
- Phase 6 AI feature suite (summaries, extraction, Q&A) with caching and telemetry.
- Navigation shell rework (sticky header, mobile sheet, theme toggle integration).
- Footer with branding, quick links, social/contact placeholders, and status badge.
- Landing page scaffolding for upcoming marketing push.
- Production-ready database config (connection pools, indexes, env wiring).

---

## Upcoming Focus (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Add clipboard helpers + partial exports (time-range selection research).
2. Prototype SRT generator for long-form videos (beta flag).
3. Add Playwright smoke test to validate export workflows end-to-end.
4. Update docs/marketing copy to highlight export capabilities.

---

## Open Risks
- **Export performance**: Need streaming responses to handle large transcripts without overwhelming memory.
- **Rate limits**: Popular export formats may invite high-frequency usage; consider throttling when API ships.
- **Testing gaps**: No automated UI coverage yet; Playwright integration is part of the export deliverable.

Mitigations are tracked in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` Phase 7.

## Decision Log
- 2025-10-22: Confirmed Next.js + shadcn UI stack as permanent direction (replaces legacy Solid.js notes).
- 2025-10-22: Prioritized Export workflows before Production Hardening.
- 2025-10-10: Adopted dedicated Postgres instances for dev/prod parity.

---

## Metrics
- **Backend tests**: `go test ./...` ‚Äì ‚úÖ passing (latest run 2025-10-21).
- **Frontend linting**: `pnpm lint` ‚Äì ‚úÖ clean.
- **Performance**: Transcript fetch < 2s (cached), AI calls 2‚Äì5s uncached, <100ms cached.
- **Uptime**: No incidents reported in staging.

---

## Callouts
- Marketing/landing content will need refresh once export goes live.
- Observability work (Phase 8) scheduled to start immediately after export release.
- Translation & semantic search remain optional backlog items.
